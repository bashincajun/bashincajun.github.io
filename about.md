I have been in IT since around 2006 back when computers still had a floppy drive and Blackberrys were the standard for "smartphone".  During my time in the field I have worked in several areas, everything from Desktop support, Network Admin, Web Administrator, System architect and a few more in between. Even filled multiple of those roles at the same time.  I ventured over into infosec a few years ago and have worked on both Red teams and Blue teams.  I enjoy both roles in security and firmly believe that happiness is somewhere in the middle.  While i may have a number of years in the industry the best part is there is always so much to learn and explore.

I hope that I am able to share the level of knowledge that has been shared with me over the years.  My goal with this blog effort is to be a positive influence in IT and Infosec communities and to find a way to give back to the community that has helped me grow in my various roles over the years.
